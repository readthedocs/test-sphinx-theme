Paragraph Level Markup
**********************

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Inline Markup
=============

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``,
standalone hyperlinks (http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks (Python_), internal cross-references (example_),
external hyperlinks with embedded URIs (`Python web site <http://www.python.org>`__), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_),
citation references ([12]_), substitution references (|example|), and _`inline hyperlink targets`
(see Targets_ below for a reference back to here). Character-level inline markup is also possible
(although exceedingly ugly!) in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*. Problems are indicated by |problematic|
text (generated by processing errors; this one is intentional).

Also with ``sphinx.ext.autodoc``, which I use in the demo, I can link to :class:`test_py_module.test.Foo`.
It will link you right to my code documentation for it.

The default role for interpreted text is `Title Reference`.  Here are some explicit interpreted text roles:
a PEP reference (:PEP:`287`); an RFC reference (:RFC:`2822`); a :sub:`subscript`; a :sup:`superscript`;
and explicit roles for :emphasis:`standard` :strong:`inline` :literal:`markup`.

GUI labels are a useful way to indicate that :guilabel:`Some action` is to be taken by the user.
The GUI label should not run over ``line-height`` so as not to :guilabel:`interfere` with text from adjacent lines.

Key-bindings indicate that the read is to press a button on the keyboard or mouse,
for example :kbd:`MMB` and :kbd:`Shift-MMB`. Another useful markup to indicate a user action
is to use ``menuselection`` this can be used to show short and long menus in software.
For example, and ``menuselection`` can be seen here that breaks is too long to fit on this line.
:menuselection:`My --> Software --> Some menu --> Some sub menu 1 --> sub menu 2`.

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a live link to PEP 258 here.

Math
====

This is a test. Here is an equation:
:math:`X_{0:5} = (X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)`.
Here is another:

.. math::
    :label: This is a label

    \nabla^2 f =
    \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}
    \left( \sin \theta \, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}

You can add a link to equations like the one above :eq:`This is a label` by using ``:eq:``.

Meta
====

.. meta::
   :keywords: reStructuredText, demonstration, demo, parser
   :description lang=en: A demonstration of the reStructuredText
       markup language, containing examples of all basic
       constructs and many advanced constructs.
       
Blocks
======

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks

Sidebar
=======

.. sidebar:: Ch'ien / The Creative

    .. image:: static/yi_jing_01_chien.jpg

    *Above* CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

    *Below* CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power,
which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character,
and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven.
Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.
Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.
Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.

The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action
on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong,
creative action of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage,
of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.

Code with Sidebar

References
==========

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.

Citations
---------

.. [11] This is the citation I made, let's make this extremely long so that we can tell that it doesn't follow the normal responsive table stuff.

.. [12] This citation has some ``code blocks`` in it, maybe some **bold** and
       *italics* too. Heck, lets put a link to a meta citation [13]_ too.

.. [13] This citation will have two backlinks.


Here's a reference to the above, [12]_, and a [nonexistent]_ citation.

Here is another type of citation: `citation`

Glossary
--------

This is a glossary with definition terms for thing like :term:`Writing`:

.. glossary::
  
  Documentation
     Provides users with the knowledge they need to use something.

  Reading
     The process of taking information into ones mind through the use of eyes.

  Writing
     The process of putting thoughts into a medium for other people to :term:`read <Reading>`.

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target.
A reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as "Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_, which generates an error.


Directives
==========

          A. upper alpha.

             I) upper roman)

#. List items may also be auto-enumerated.

Definition Lists
----------------

Term

Term : classifier
    Definition paragraph 1.

    Definition paragraph 2.
Term
    Definition

I have no clue why the definition list below is classified as a different style
of definition list than the one above.

Is it the spaces in the term?
    Maybe it was the multiple line paragraph
    in the line below that caused this?

Is it the paragraph above the list maybe?
    I guess a lot of these lists don't have leading paragraphs?

Is it everything all at once?
    Who knows?!

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the description.

..
    Docutils supports two types of lists, "simple" and "complex". Complex lists
    have item margins, simple lists do not.
    https://docutils.sourceforge.io/sandbox/html4strict/data/simple-lists.html

Simple
^^^^^^

- A simple list.
- There are no margins between list items.
- Simple lists do not contain multiple paragraphs. That's a complex list.
- In the case of a nested list

  - There are no margins between elements

    - Still no margins

      - Still no margins

Complex
^^^^^^^

- A bullet list

  + Nested bullet list.
  + Nested item 2.

- Item 2.

  Paragraph 2 of item 2.

  * Nested bullet list.
  * Nested item 2.

    - Third level.
    - Item 2.

  * Nested item 3.

- ``inline literall``
- ``inline literall``
- ``inline literall``
- This item has multiple paragraphs.

  This item has multiple paragraphs.
- This item has multiple paragraphs.

  This item has multiple paragraphs.

- `yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`_

  - `yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`_
  - here is an inner bullet ``oh``

    - one more ``with an inline literally``. `yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`_

      heh heh. child. try to beat this embed:

  - and another. `yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`_
  - `yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`_
  - ``hi``
- how about an admonition?

  .. note::
      This is a note nested in a list.

Generated Index
===============

Part of the sphinx build process in generate and index file: :ref:`genindex`.


Optional parameter args
=======================

At this point optional parameters `cannot be generated from code`_.
However, some projects will manually do it, like so:

This example comes from `django-payments module docs`_.

.. class:: payments.dotpay.DotpayProvider(seller_id, pin[, channel=0[, lock=False], lang='pl'])

   This backend implements payments using a popular Polish gateway, `Dotpay.pl <http://www.dotpay.pl>`_.

   Due to API limitations there is no support for transferring purchased items.


   :param seller_id: Seller ID assigned by Dotpay
   :param pin: PIN assigned by Dotpay
   :param channel: Default payment channel (consult reference guide)
   :param lang: UI language
   :param lock: Whether to disable channels other than the default selected above
